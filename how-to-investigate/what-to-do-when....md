# What to do when...?

## **You want to do something about what you care about, but don’t know how to get started?**

Political participation? Let’s say that I care about Afghanistan refugees, or the crisis in-country that I don’t perceive as getting much done by my own government, or others (international). This could also include government-related policies and activities such as in the community, eg. school district things need improved, or things that might be investigated by a nonprofit/volunteer organization. Another might be in practical terms. Such as: everyone has lost electrical power, and it’s up to you to determine what everyone’s needs are, and how to meet/manage them. Or, there is an environmental disaster which needs to be addressed.
