## Manufacturing

Things have to be made to exist, and which by existing you are able to consume. (How’s that for something that will be hard to articulate the reasons for?) Things such as food and water (your needs are studied by nutritionists, implemented by dieticians, and manufactured by farmers/agriculturalists), shelter & proper internal temperature (your needs studied by physiologists, and implemented by medical professionals - doctors/nurses), and safety & security (physical safety might be implemented by law enforcement/first responders when emergencies - deviations from a previously good homeostasis - or in a broader sense, by the military when responding to foreign and domestic threats… psychological safety, including not being excluded from social opportunities, is studied by psychologists, and implemented by peers - family, friends, acquaintances - and psychologists as medical professionals). Some things that also may be “made” include inventions that use discoveries, such as cellphones that are powered by electrical circuits, which is a ‘product’ (not antecedent) of the discovery of electricity.

### What, and why, does “community” matter?

## Consumption
